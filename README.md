# Ternimal: Pet for your terminal. [HIGHLY WIP]

The goal for this project is to create a consistent, saveable, and hopefully loveable virtual pet that will live on your computer, or even a USB stick. 
Much like other virtual pets, you'll be able to care for it, play with it, and feed it.

Optional danger mode will allow your pet to delete files if angry.
